🔍 Fraud Detection with Machine Learning
Overview
This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline for detecting fraudulent transactions using a Logistic Regression model. Fraud detection is a critical task across domains such as finance, banking, and e-commerce, where malicious behavior can cause significant financial and reputational damage. This notebook provides a clear and reproducible example of how to approach fraud detection using real-world structured data.

The primary goal is to build a reliable classification model capable of distinguishing between legitimate and fraudulent transactions based on features like transaction details and user behavior. The model is trained using a streamlined ML pipeline built with Scikit-learn, handling preprocessing, feature encoding, and training in a modular, scalable manner.

🧠 Problem Statement
Detecting fraud is challenging due to:

High class imbalance (fraud is rare compared to normal activity)

Evolving fraudulent tactics

Varied data types (categorical + numerical)

In this notebook, we focus on:

Proper preprocessing for mixed data types

Building a logistic regression model with encoded features

Evaluating model performance for practical use

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
Python

Pandas – for data loading and manipulation

Scikit-learn – for preprocessing, pipelines, and modeling

OneHotEncoder – for handling categorical features

ColumnTransformer – to apply different preprocessing strategies

Pipeline – to combine steps into a clean, end-to-end process

📊 Project Workflow
Data Preparation

Load dataset using pandas

Separate features and target variable

Drop or encode irrelevant/categorical columns

Data Splitting

Use train_test_split to create training and testing datasets

Preprocessing

Identify and one-hot encode categorical features

Keep numerical features unchanged

Use ColumnTransformer to combine preprocessing steps

Modeling

Build a pipeline that includes preprocessing and LogisticRegression

Train the model on training data

Evaluation

Predict on the test set

Measure accuracy, and identify opportunities for improvement
